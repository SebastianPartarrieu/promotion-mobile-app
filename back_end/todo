Before presentation Friday:
- constraints on min amount of characters for passwords
- refactor code
- think about patching location
- Documentation of image helper functions
- work on presentation
- possibly deploy app
- Final FE stuff

If time for the near-future:
- generate QR codes for client fidelity card and have commerce scan these
- blueprint to split flask app.py into multiple cleaned up files
- more complex form of suggestion sending based on user interaction, clicks, time spent viewing commerce etc..

If ever deployed on a 'real' server for 'real' usage:
- implementing password changes and secure signup with automated e-mail sending or 2FA
- refresh tokens to better handle duration of tokens and account deleted
- add admin functionalities and interface so that an admin may check images, handle commerce accounts and the like
