When we will link everything to front end, there will be lots of things to keep in mind.
Here is a short (non exhaustive) list of some of these:
- we will need to store clid and cid locally on FE
- format of categorie names "restaurant,textile"

Random things to keep in mind:
- If we add Image table we need to make sure to drop it in drop.sql and truncate in truncate.sql
- Same for any other added tables (card scanning functionnality for example)
- Need to install pyjwt for tokens to work.
- pid for promotion will be kept with image. If we click on image of promotion and want to go see it's info.
- if token expires need to go back to login page on FE
- Be careful for added ' and \n or other escape sequences in strings. Might be a problem when FE sends a token
- ID will be received on signup and stored locally.
- when you login, you receive token. Token to be sent with subsequent http requests 
- token is truly best mechanism as HTTP Basic Authentication wouldn't work well with the web app for commerce.
- Be cafeful for updating ranks for immages of commerce and promtion. Need to keep list of ranks and imid locally and wait for server response before updating.
