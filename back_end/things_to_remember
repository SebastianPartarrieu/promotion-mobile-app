When we will link everything to front end, there will be lots of things to keep in mind.
Here is a short (non exhaustive) list of some of these:
- on /login it's an HTTP get because we send the clid back
- we will need to store clid and cid locally on FE
- login FE page should have email, pwd, remember me tick box, , create a new account, change existing pwd
- format of categorie names 

Random things to keep in mind:
- If we add Image table we need to make sure to drop it in drop.sql and truncate in truncate.sql
- Same for any other added tables (card scanning functionnality for example)
